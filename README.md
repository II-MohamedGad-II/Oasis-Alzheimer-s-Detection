# OASIS Alzheimer's Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting Alzheimer's disease using the OASIS dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Import and preprocess MRI brain scan data
- Train a deep learning model for Alzheimer's classification
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize results

## Repository Structure
- `oasis-alzheimer's-detection-final.ipynb` - Contains all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. Open `oasis-alzheimer's-detection-final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## Dataset
This project uses the **OASIS** dataset, which includes MRI scans for Alzheimer's detection.

## Acknowledgments
- **OASIS dataset** for providing MRI scans.
- **TensorFlow & OpenCV** for deep learning and image processing.

Feel free to contribute or raise issues if you have suggestions or improvements!
